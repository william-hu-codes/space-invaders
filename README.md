# space-invaders
This is my remake of the legendary arcade game, Space Invaders, that was developed by Tomohiro Nishikado. Although simplified, my game consists of the same fixed-shooter frameowrk that Space Invaders first introduced to this game genre.

I hope this game successfully demonstrates all my newly acquired JS, CSS, and HTML skills!
